	<p>
		All these features are awesome, but how about users who don't have JS enabled, low-end devices, existing apps which don't want to migrate their workflow entirely.
		<br>
		Well, these can be use indipendently!
		<br>
		Every app existing or in development can benefit from integrating a bunch of these practices, and new apps can adopt these by gracefully degrating on older browsers.
		<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		You don't need to restructure your whole app to add offline cache, just trow in a Service Worker, and if the browser has that feature is a win for the user!
	</p>
	<p>
		Always make sure your content is accesible in every situation, the add polishings and UI features ontop.
		<br>
		With modern technologies is easy to build isomorphic applications and to scale the fanciness of the experience basing on support we have, and it does pay in happy users and all sort of good things (SEO fiendliness, ...)
	</p>

		A sample implementation of the PWA pattern, which is fully progressive, is the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/application-shell">AppShell</a>.
