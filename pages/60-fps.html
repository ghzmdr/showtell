	<p>
		Native applications are often prefered because they're smoother.
		<br/>
		They have access to more performance so they can privide a more enjoyable UI.
	</p>
	<p>
		By analyzing what we really need and applying modern techniques we can achieve that on the web too. 
	</p>
	<h4>Layer Promotion</h4>
	<p>
		Select <b>Primed elements</b>, those which are hierarchically separated in your UI and will be animated.
		<br>
		Promote those layers by establishing a stacking context, so transitions will be smoother.
		<br>
		This can be done via the <code>will-change</code> CSS property. Statically for content which is known to change, dinamically for elements which we're not sure will be interacted with. 
		<br>
		The only properties to be changed (thus will-change set to) are <code>transform</code> and <code>opacity</code> 
	</p>
	<h4>Passive Listeners</h4>
	<p>
		By passing <code>{passive: true}</code> to the <code>addEventListener</code> for listeners such as <code>touchmove</code>, <code>scroll</code>, <code>mousemove</code> we can promise to the browser that we won't call <code>preventDefault()</code> so it can ship the frame without waiting for our handler to quit.
	</p>
	<h4>FLIP</h4>
	<p>
		FLIP is a guideline for creating runtime animations, it describes a flow for obtaining maximum performance while using non-safe properties like <code>width</code> <code>left</code>, etc.
		<br>
		It does count on applying those properties only once. So just 1 Style and 1 Layout will happen in the browser.
		<br>
		No transitions are applied on these properties, this will usually happen in less than 100ms.
		<br>

		Full flow:
		<ul>
			<li>Snapshot <b>F</b>irst state (position and opacity).</li>
			<li>Apply the <b>L</b>ast state and snapshot it.</li>
			<li>Calculate transforms needed to transition.</li>
			<li><b>I</b>nvert the animation (to restore the initial state).</li>
			<li><b>P</b>lay it forwards.</li>
		</ul>
		
		which translates to:

		<code class="multiline">
			var first = item.getBoundingClientRect()<br>
			item.classList.add('last')<br>
			<br>
			// [...] wait for changes to be propagated in the browser (Styles + Layout)<br>
			var last = item.getBoundingClientRect()<br>
			<br>
			// [...] calculate needed transforms<br>
			<br>
			// apply them to revert back to initial position<br>
			item.style.transform = "[...]"<br>
			<br>
			// switch on CSS transitions <br>
			item.classList.add('animatable')<br>
			<br>
			//wipe transform property to play the animation forwards <br>
			item.style.transform = ""
		</code>
