	<h3>Ending</h3>
	<p>
		That's not even close to be exaustive and there's tons of material, most of it being drafted right now,
		but that's a good peek at what we can already do on the web today.
		<br>
		By rethinking our application flow this way we can improve every user's experience, and by adding more features incrementally, we can delight users with more updated technologies with a native-link experience.

	<h4>P.S.</h4>
	<b>If you're on a supported device (Latest chrome, latest android)</b>
	<p>
		This application is a PWA, if you visit this website for a couple of times on supported browsers, you'll be prompted to add it to the homescreen.
		<br>
		It is accessible without JS, thanks to server-side templating.
		<br>
		Also pages are cached while you browse them, so by now all of them should be available offline!
