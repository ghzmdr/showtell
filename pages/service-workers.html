	<h3>Service Workers</h3>
	<p>
		SWs are JavaScript scripts that <b>run beneath the main JS</b> application.
		They're not part of the normal JS flow, they operate closer to the browser.
	</p>
	<p>
		They can <b>intercept network calls</b> from the main application and manipulate them.
		This, combined with the possibility of <b>manipulating browser caches</b>, gives SWs an enormous power.
		<br>
		And even better: your main app doesn't have to know anything about this business. 
	</p>
	<p>
		True native applications don't wait for you to open them to display new content, they <b>sync in background</b>.
		SWs can be <em>'installed'</em> in the browser so they can fetch updates silently.
		<br>
		Once new content is fetched, say... a new email, maybe you'd like to use <b>push notifications API</b> to let the user know. 
	</p>
	<p>
		These are huge steps towards creating web experiences which are comparable in functionality to native ones, but are more lightweight and flexible.
