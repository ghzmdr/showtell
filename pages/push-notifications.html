		PN are great way to trigger user engagement
		<br/>
		When used properly they can be a great way add value to the UX by providing content in the right moment and context.
		<br/>
		When used improperly they became a reason for the user to uninstall your intrusive app and lower it's trust in your brand. 
	</p>

	<p>
		A notification can be consdered properly crafted if:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Timely</b> - Is triggered in the exact moment it's needed.</li>
			<li><b>Precise</b> - Shows the minimum amount of informations needed</li>
			<li><b>Relevant</b> - Adds information on the user's context, prompts for quick reactions</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		PNs are implemented trough Service Workers, which (after being installed) subscribe themselves to the server.
		<br/>
		This way, whenever a notification is sent, the SW will be woken up to handle that message.
