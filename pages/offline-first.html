	<h3>Offline First</h3>

	<p>
		The web is <b>slow</b>. Our mobile networks are slow and we feel bad about it.
		<br>
		Native applications don't generate <b>frustrating</b> experiences like a <em>'You're Offline'</em> page because they're built to be offline first! 
		<br>
		The application <b>code resides on the device</b> and doesn't need to be re-downloaded every time.
		<b>Content can be cached</b>, so the user can enjoy most of the app's functionalities even offline or on bad network conditions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Building an offline-first web application means to replicate this behavior. 
		Saving the main application in the browser's cache, and fetching content ondemand.
	</p>
	<p>	
		The web platform is supporting this pattern via the new <a href="/pages/service-workers">Service Workers</a>
		API.
